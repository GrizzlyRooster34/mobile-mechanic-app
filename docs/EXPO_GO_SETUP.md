# Expo Go Setup Instructions

This guide will help you set up and test the Heinicus Mobile Mechanic app using Expo Go for rapid development and testing.

## üì± What is Expo Go?

Expo Go is a free app that allows you to run Expo projects on your physical device without building a standalone app. It's perfect for:
- Rapid prototyping and development
- Testing on real devices
- Sharing work-in-progress with stakeholders
- Quick iterations and debugging

## üöÄ Quick Setup

3. Install the app by Expo
4. Open the app and create an account (optional)

**Android**
1. Open Google Play Store
2. Search for "Expo Go"
3. Install the app by Expo
4. Open the app and create an account (optional)

### Step 2: Development Environment Setup

   ```

### Step 3: Start Development Server

1. **Start the Expo Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run mobile
   ```

2. **You'll see output like this:**
   ```
   ‚Ä∫ Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.100:8081
   ‚Ä∫ Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)
   
   ‚Ä∫ Press a ‚îÇ open Android
   ‚Ä∫ Press i ‚îÇ open iOS simulator
   ‚Ä∫ Press w ‚îÇ open web
   
   ‚Ä∫ Press r ‚îÇ reload app

2. Tap "Scan QR Code"
3. Scan the QR code from your terminal
4. The app will load on your device

**Method 2: Manual Connection**
1. Ensure your device and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. In Expo Go, tap "Enter URL manually"
3. Enter the URL shown in your terminal (e.g., `exp://192.168.1.100:8081`)

## üîß Configuration Options

### Network Configuration

If you're having connection issues, try these options:

1. **Tunnel Mode** (works through firewalls)
   ```bash
   npm run mobile:tunnel
   ```

2. **LAN Mode** (faster, requires same network)
   ```bash
   npm run mobile
   ```

3. **Localhost Mode** (simulator only)
   ```bash
   expo start --localhost
   ```

### Environment-Specific Setup

**Development Environment**
```bash
# Start with development configuration
npm run mobile:dev
```

**Production Testing**
```bash
# Test production build locally
expo start --no-dev --minify
```
